# QW0014: Define global using statements separately

Defining using statements globally is wonderful way of reducing using statements
in code files. To keep things maintainable, however, it is advised to have
dedicated code files that only contain global using statements and no global
using statements elsewhere.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
global using System;
global using System.Collections.Generic;
global using System.Linq;

.. any other code
```

## Compliant
``` C#
global using System;
global using System.Collections.Generic;
global using System.Linq;
```
