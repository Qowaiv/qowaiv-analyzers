# QW0100: Define only one Required attribute

The `[Required]` attribute is designed to be used in isolation. It usage is
defined as follows:

``` C#
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Field | AttributeTargets.Parameter, AllowMultiple = false)]
```

The reasoning for this is, that if the required constraint is not met, no
further validation is done. When `[Required]` is overridden (by `[Any]`,
`[Mandatory]`,  `[Optional]`, or whatever which implementation) this constraint
should still apply but the compiler will not longer enforce this, hence this
rule.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
class Model
{
    [Any]
    [Required]
    public int[] Numbers { get; init; }
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
class Model
{
    [Any]
    public int[] Numbers { get; init; }
}
