# QW0005: Seal concrete classes unless designed for inheritance
Inheritance is one of the pillars of Object Oriented Programming. Designing a
class to support inheritance however, is hard. As a consequence, it is
considered a bad practice to unintentionally allowing a class to be
inheritable.

## Design challenges
By allowing inheritance one must consider the consequences of derived classes
changing the state initialization, as it might effect method and (calculated) 
property calls that not longer rightfully assume their preconditions to be met.

Things like equality (if not by reference), serialization, and projections
become less straightforward. This can all be solved of course, but it requires
effort. If you're not willing to put in this effort (yet); seal the class.

By sealing a class, the code also tells a story: as far as this code base is
concerned: this concept is fully covered by this class, no detail (relevant to
the application) is left out.

## Performance
Calling virtual methods and properties have a small performance penalty. This
is due to the fact that the CLR has to check the type runtime in order to
determine which type defines the method/property. In sealed classes the JIT
compiler can treat virtual methods and properties of sealed classes as
non-virtual ones, bypassing the CLR runtime check. In other words, there is a
small performance gain in sealing a class.

## Designed for inheritance
According to this rule, a (concrete) class is considered to be designed for
inheritance when:
1. It defines at least one virtual member
2. It defines at least one protected member
3. It is decorated with a `[Inheritable]` attribute (name convention based)

## Non-compliant
``` C#
public class Noncompliant
{
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
public class Compliant
{
    protected object Method() { } // any protected member
}

public class Compliant
{
    public virtual object Method() { } // any virtual member
}

[Inheritable] // Name convention based way to decorate a class
public class Compliant
{
}
```
