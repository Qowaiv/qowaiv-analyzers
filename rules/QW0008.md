# QW0008: Do not use nullabillity on properties with value types that have an empty state
Types like `System.Guid` and `Qowaiv.EmailAddress` are value types with an
empty state. Creating models with those types as nullables is inconvenient
as the check `.HasValue` still does not tell if the value is not empty.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public Guid? Id { get; }
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public Guid Id { get; }
}
```
