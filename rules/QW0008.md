# QW0008: Define properties as not-nullable for types with an empty state

The purpose of [`Nullable<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types)
is to provide an additional [`null`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/null)
(or empty) value on top of its underlying value.

Types like `System.Guid` and `Qowaiv.EmailAddress` are value types that have a
well defined empty/null state. Creating models with those types as nullables is
inconvenient as the check `.HasValue` still does not tell if the value is not
empty.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public Guid? Id { get; }
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public Guid Id { get; }
}
```
