# QW0102: Use compliant validation attributes

Validation attributes are designed to validate certain member types. When
applied on other types, this is invalid, and might even crash.

Which types are supported by a validator can be defined by decorating a
validator either with `[Valdates(typeof(ValidatedType))]` or
`[Validates(GenericArgument = true)]` when is assumed that the the
generic argument of the attribute is equal to the that is suppored.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
class Model
{
    [Allowed<int>(42, 2017)]
    public string Number { get; init; }
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
class Model
{
    [Allowed<string>("42", "2017")]
    public string Number { get; init; }
}
```
