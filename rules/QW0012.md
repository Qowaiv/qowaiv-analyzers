# QW0012: Use immutable types for properties

Immutable types (classes, interfaces, records, structs) have multiple advantages.
Those include, but are not limited to:
* Predictable Behavior
  Immutable objects exhibit predictable behavior because their state remains
  constant. This predictability simplifies debugging and makes the code easier
  to reason about, reducing the chances of subtle bugs.
* Thread Safety
  Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe. Since their state cannot change
  after creation, multiple threads can safely access them concurrently without
  the risk of race conditions or data corruption.
* Functional Programming Benefits
  Immutable objects align well with functional programming principles.
* Caching and Reusability
  Immutable objects can be safely cached. Once an immutable object is created,
  it can be shared across different parts of the codebase without worrying
  about unintended modifications.
* Easier Testing
  Testing becomes more straightforward when dealing with immutable objects.
  Since their behavior is consistent and their state doesn't change, you can
  create test cases that rely on this consistency.
* Simplified Error Handling
  Immutable objects are less prone to errors because their state doesn't
  change. This means that once you handle an immutable object correctly, you
  can trust its state throughout the program's execution.

This rule assumes that the code base contains only read-only types/models
unless explicitly defined otherwise, using a `[Mutable]` attribute to decorate
the type. In all other cases, type of the property should be immutable.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
public class SomeClass
{
    public List<int> Values { get; init; }
}
```

## Compliant
Using an immutable alternative
``` C#
public class SomeClass(int value)
{
    public IReadOnlyList<int> Values { get; init; }
}
```

Decorating a model as mutable.
``` C#
[Mutable]
public class SomeClass
{
    public List<int> Values { get; init; }
}
```
