# QW0006: Only unsealed concrete classes should be decorated as inheritable
The naming convention based `[Inheritable]` attribute that can indicate that a
class is [designed to be inheritable](QW0005.md), should not be used to
decorate static, sealed, or abstract classes.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
[Inheritable]
public static class StaticClass { }

[Inheritable]
public sealed class SealedClass { } 

[Inheritable]
public abstract class AbstractClass { } 
```

## Compliant
``` C#
public static class StaticClass { }

public sealed class SealedClass { } 

public abstract class AbstractClass { } 
```
