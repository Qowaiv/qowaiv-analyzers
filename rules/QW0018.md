# QW0018: Use Qowaiv.Clock.TimeProvider

Microsoft introduced the [`System.TimeProvider`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/datetime/timeprovider-overview)
as a means to provide a [testable time provider](QW0001.md). It relies on
dependency to provide testability.

[Qowaiv's Clock](https://github.com/Qowaiv/Qowaiv/?tab=readme-ov-file#qowaiv-clock)
also provides a testable time provider without relying on dependency injection.
To ensure that both the `System.TimeProvider` implementation and `Qowaiv.Clock.UtcNow()`
yield the same behavior, the `Qowaiv.Clock.TimeProvider` should be used. As an
additional benefit, `System.TimeProvider` instance does not have to be changed
under test.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
var service = new Service(TimeProvider.System);
```

## Compliant
``` C#
var service = new Service(Qowaiv.Clock.TimeProvider);
