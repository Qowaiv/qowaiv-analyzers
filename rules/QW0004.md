# QW0004: Characters with Trojan Horse potential are not allowed
(Unicode) Characters that are not displayed in IDE's have the potential to be
Trojan Horses; code will be interpreted differently, than may be concluded from
reading the source code. Therefore usage is not allowed.

In practice all characters in the categories: Control, Format, Surrogate, and
Not Assigned, are off limits, unless, they have been known to be part of
alternative 'alphabets', like Chinese and Cyrillic.
