# QW0003: Decorate pure functions
Pure methods do not make any visible state changes. Its only purpose is to
return a value. If it returns a value, and that value is subsequently ignored,
then there was no reason to call the method in the first place. Therefore, the
warning would always indicate a mistake.

By enabling [CA1806](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1806)
the compiler will inform on ignoring the return value.

As it is - in most cases - hard to determine if a function in pure, or impure,
this rule enforces the code to also decorate all impure methods. This ensures
that the developer has to explicitly decorate all methods.

This rule should only be enabled, for libraries, where that burden is worth it.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
public class Noncompliant
{
    public int PureFunction() => 42; // Noncompliant
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
public class Compliant
{
    [Pure]
    public int PureFunction() => 42;

    [Obsolete]
    public int Obsolete() => 0; // Obsolete methods are ignored.

    public void Void() { } // Void methods are impure per definition.

    public bool TryParse(string str, out object result) // Methods with out parameters are expected to be impure.
    {
        if (str is null)
        {
            result = default;
            return false;
        }
        else
        {
            result = str;
            return true;
        }
    }

    public int GuardPositive(int number) => number; // Guarding is expected to be impure.

    [Impure]
    public int ImpureMethod(int input) => 69; // Decorated with (something derived from) an ImpureAttribute.

    [CustomAssertion]
    public T SomeAssertion<T>(T subject) => subject; // Decorated with something indicating an assertion is done.
}

public class Guard
{
    public T NotNull<T>(T obj) => obj; // Methods on a Guard class are expected to be impure.
}

[Obsolete]
public class ObsoleteClass
{
    public int Function() => 42; Obsolete classes are ignored.
}
```
