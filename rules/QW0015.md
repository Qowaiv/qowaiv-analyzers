# QW0015: Define global using statements in single file

Defining using statements globally is wonderful way of reducing using statements
in code files. To keep things maintainable, however, all global using statements
should be defined in a single file.

By default, this rule prefers `"Properties/GlobalUsings.cs"`.  Visual Studio
(and other IDE's for C#) consider `Properties` a special directory, which is
displayed differently. This helps finding the global using statements.e.

## Configuration
If desired, another location can be configured:

``` INI
dotnet_diagnostic.QW0015.GlobalUsingsFile = Usings.cs
```
