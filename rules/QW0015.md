# QW0015: Define global using statements in single file

Defining using statements globally is wonderful way of reducing using statements
in code files. To keep things maintainable, however, all global using statements
should be defined in a single file. This rule prefers `"Properties/GlobalUsings.cs"`.

The reason for this location is, that Visual Studio (and other IDE's for C#)
show the `Properties` folder differently than other directories, and it are,
that you could argue that it are properties from a compiler perspective.

## Configuration
If desired, another location can be configured:

``` INI
dotnet_diagnostic.QW0015.GlobalUsingsFile = Usings.cs
```
