# QW0009: Define properties as not-nullable for enums with a defined none value

The purpose of [`Nullable<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types)
is to provide an additional [`null`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/null)
(or empty) value on top of its underlying value.

Enums that define a `None` or `Empty` value (as their default) have a well
defined empty/null state. Creating models with those types as nullables is
inconvenient as the check `.HasValue` still does not tell if the value is not
empty.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public MyENum? Value { get; }
}

SomeRecord(MyENum? Value);

enum MyENum
{
    None = 0,
}
```

## Compliant
``` C#
SomeClass
{
    public MyENum Value { get; }
}

SomeRecord(MyENum Value);

enum MyENum
{
    None = 0,
}
```
