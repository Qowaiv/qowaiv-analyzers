# QW0007: Use file-scoped namespace declarations
 To reduce the number of braces in a file, and also to eliminate the wasted
 horizontal space to the left of the class definition, since it no longer needs
 to be indented, it is recommended to use file-scoped namespaces.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
namespace SomeNamespace { }
```

## Compliant
``` C#
namespace SomeNamespace;
```
