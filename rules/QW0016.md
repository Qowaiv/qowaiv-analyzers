# QW0016: Prefer regular over positional properties 

With the release of C# 10, [`record`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record)'s
have been introduced. One of the advocated advantages is the possibility to use
a so called primary constructor which allows you to define a full data structure
in a single line:

``` C#
record MyRecord(string Message, string Other);
```

However powerful, for (public) APIs it turns out to be not that practical:
Defining attributes or adding documentation turns out to be counterintuitive and
cumbersome. Having numerous properties (let's say 3 or more) also makes it
less readable.

Therefore this rule reports on primary constructors on public records, and 
provides a code fix to help refactoring.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
/// <summary>Represents a data structure.</summary>
/// <param name="Required">
/// Gets the required value.
/// </param>
/// <param name="Optional">
/// Gets the optional value.
/// </param>
/// <param name="WithDefault">
/// Gets the value provided by default.
/// </param>
public record DataStructure([Length(16)]string Required, object? Optional, int WithDefault = 42);
```

## Compliant
``` C#
/// <summary>Represents a data structure.</summary>
public record DataStructure
{
    /// <summary>Gets the required value.</summary>
    [Length(16)]
    public required string Required { get; init; }
    
    /// <summary>Gets the optional value.</summary>
    public object? Optional { get; init; }
    
    /// <summary>Gets the value provided by default.</summary>
    public int WithDefault { get; init; } = 42;
}
