# QW0016: Prefer regular over positional properties 

With the release of C# 10, [`record`'s](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record)
have been introduced. One of the advocated advantages is possibility to use a
so called primary constructor which allows to define a full data structure in
a single line:

``` C#
record MyRecord(string Message, string Other);
```

However powerful, for (public) API's it turns out to be not that practical:
Defining attributes, having numerous (Let say 3 or more) properties, or
documentation, turns out to be counter intuitive and cumbersome.

Therefor this rule reports on primary constructors on public records, and 
provides code fix to help refactoring.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
public record DataStructure(string Required, object? Optional, int WIth Default = 42);
```

## Compliant
``` C#
public record DataStructure
{
    public required string Required { get; init; }
    
    public object? Optional { get; init; }
    
    public int WIth Default { get; init; } =  42
}
