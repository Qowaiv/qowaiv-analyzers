# QW0017: Apply arithmetic operations on non-nullables only 

.NET allows arithmetic operations between nullable value types. The outcome of
those operations will potentially by `null` if any of the operants has no value
runtime. This behavior is commonly undesirable, and occurrences are not trivial
to spot, potentially leading to bugs.
## Non-compliant

``` C#
var sum = model.Child?.Amount + model.Other.Total;
```

## Compliant
``` C#
var sum = (model.Child?.Amount ?? 0) + model.Other.Total;
````
