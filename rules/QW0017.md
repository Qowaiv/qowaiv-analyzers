# QW0017: Apply arithmetic operations on non-nullables only 

.NET allows arithmetic operations between nullable value types. The outcome of
those operations will potentially be `null` if any of the operants has no value
at runtime. This behavior is usually undesirable, and occurrences are not trivial
to spot, potentially leading to bugs.

## Non-compliant
``` C#
var sum = model.Child?.Amount + model.Other.Total;
```

## Compliant
Define a fallback per value.
``` C#
var sum = (model.Child?.Amount ?? 0) + model.Other.Total;
````

## Compliant
Define a fallback for the full expression
``` C#
var sum = (model.Child?.Amount + model.Other.Total) ?? 0;
````
